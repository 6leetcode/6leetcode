### [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays)

There are two sorted arrays __nums1__ and __nums2__ of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

You may assume __nums1__ and __nums1__ cannot be both empty.

__Example 1:__

```
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0
```

__Example 2:__

```
nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5
```
