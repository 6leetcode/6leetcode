### [Container With Most Water](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

__Note:__ You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array `[1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]`. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

__Example:__

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
