### [Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an array `nums`, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

__Example__:

```
Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

__Note__:

You must do this __in-place__ without making a copy of the array.
Minimize the total number of operations.
