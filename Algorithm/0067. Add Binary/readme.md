### [Add Binary](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/add-binary/)

Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).

The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters `1` orÂ `0`.

__Example 1__:

```
Input: a = "11", b = "1"
Output: "100"
```

__Example 2__:

```
Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
Output: "10101"
```

__Constraints__:

- Each string consists only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10^4`
- Each string is either `"0"` or doesn't contain any leading zero.
