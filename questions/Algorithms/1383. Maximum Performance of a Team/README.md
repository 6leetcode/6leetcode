### [Maximum Performance of a Team](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-performance-of-a-team)

<p>There are <code>n</code> engineers numbered from 1 to <code>n</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;two arrays: <code>speed</code>&nbsp;and <code>efficiency</code>, where <code>speed[i]</code> and <code>efficiency[i]</code> represent the speed and efficiency for the i-th engineer respectively. <em>Return the maximum <strong>performance</strong> of a team composed of&nbsp;at most&nbsp;<code>k</code>&nbsp;engineers, since the answer can be a huge number, return this modulo&nbsp;10^9 + 7.</em></p>

<p>The <strong>performance</strong> of a team is the sum of their engineers&#39; speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among&nbsp;their engineers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 60
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
We have the maximum performance of the team by selecting engineer 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and engineer 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). That is, performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 68
<strong>Explanation:
</strong>This is the same example as the first but k = 3. We can select engineer 1, engineer 2 and engineer 5 to get the maximum performance of the team. That is, performance = (2 + 10 + 5) * min(5, 4, 7) = 68.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> n = 6, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2], k = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 72
