### [Remove All Adjacent Duplicates In String](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-all-adjacent-duplicates-in-string)

<p>Given a string <code>S</code> of lowercase letters, a <em>duplicate removal</em> consists of choosing two adjacent and equal letters, and removing&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>We repeatedly make duplicate removals on S until we no longer can.</p>

<p>Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made.&nbsp; It is guaranteed the answer is unique.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong><span id="example-input-1-1">&quot;abbaca&quot;</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">&quot;ca&quot;</span>
<strong>Explanation: </strong>
For example, in &quot;abbaca&quot; we could remove &quot;bb&quot; since the letters are adjacent and equal, and this is the only possible move.&nbsp; The result of this move is that the string is &quot;aaca&quot;, of which only &quot;aa&quot; is possible, so the final string is &quot;ca&quot;.

	<li><code>1 &lt;= S.length &lt;= 20000</code></li>
	<li><code>S</code> consists only of English lowercase letters.</li>
</ol>
