### [Is Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/is-subsequence)

<p>
Given a string <b>s</b> and a string <b>t</b>, check if <b>s</b> is subsequence of <b>t</b>.
</p>

<p>
You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both <b>s</b> and <b>t</b>. <b>t</b> is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and <b>s</b> is a short string (<=100).
</p>

<p>
A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<b>s</b> = <code>"abc"</code>, <b>t</b> = <code>"ahbgdc"</code>
</p>
<p>
Return <code>true</code>.
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<b>s</b> = <code>"axc"</code>, <b>t</b> = <code>"ahbgdc"</code>
</p>
<p>
Return <code>false</code>.
</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b><br />
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?</p>
