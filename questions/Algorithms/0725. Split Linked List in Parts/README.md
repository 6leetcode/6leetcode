### [Split Linked List in Parts](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-linked-list-in-parts)

<p>Given a (singly) linked list with head node <code>root</code>, write a function to split the linked list into <code>k</code> consecutive linked list "parts".
</p><p>
The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than 1.  This may lead to some parts being null.
</p><p>
The parts should be in order of occurrence in the input list, and parts occurring earlier should always have a size greater than or equal parts occurring later.
</p><p>
Return a List of ListNode's representing the linked list parts that are formed.
</p>

Examples
1->2->3->4, k = 5 // 5 equal parts
[ [1], 
[2],
[3],
[4],
null ]

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre style="white-space: pre-line">
<b>Input:</b> 
root = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
<b>Output:</b> [[1],[2],[3],[],[]]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The input and each element of the output are ListNodes, not arrays.
For example, the input root has root.val = 1, root.next.val = 2, \root.next.next.val = 3, and root.next.next.next = null.
The first element output[0] has output[0].val = 1, output[0].next = null.
The last element output[4] is null, but it's string representation as a ListNode is [].
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
root = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], k = 3
<b>Output:</b> [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7], [8, 9, 10]]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The input has been split into consecutive parts with size difference at most 1, and earlier parts are a larger size than the later parts.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
<li>The length of <code>root</code> will be in the range <code>[0, 1000]</code>.</li>
<li>Each value of a node in the input will be an integer in the range <code>[0, 999]</code>.</li>
<li><code>k</code> will be an integer in the range <code>[1, 50]</code>.</li>
