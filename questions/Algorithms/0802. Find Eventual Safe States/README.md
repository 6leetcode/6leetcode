### [Find Eventual Safe States](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-eventual-safe-states)

<p>We start at some node in a directed graph, and every turn, we walk along a directed edge of the graph. If we reach a terminal node (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.</p>

<p>We define a starting node to be <strong>safe</strong> if we must eventually walk to a terminal node. More specifically, there is a natural number <code>k</code>, so that we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than <code>k</code> steps for <strong>any choice of where to walk</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph</em>. The answer should be sorted in <strong>ascending</strong> order.</p>

<p>The directed graph has <code>n</code> nodes with labels from <code>0</code> to <code>n - 1</code>, where <code>n</code> is the length of <code>graph</code>. The graph is given in the following form: <code>graph[i]</code> is a list of labels <code>j</code> such that <code>(i, j)</code> is a directed edge of the graph, going from node <code>i</code> to node <code>j</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>n == graph.length</code></li>

	<li><code>graph[i]</code> is sorted in a strictly increasing order.</li>
	<li>The graph may contain self-loops.</li>
	<li>The number of edges in the graph will be in the range <code>[1, 4 * 10<sup>4</sup>]</code>.</li>
