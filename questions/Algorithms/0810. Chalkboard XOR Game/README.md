### [Chalkboard XOR Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/chalkboard-xor-game)

<p>We are given non-negative integers nums[i] which are written on a chalkboard.&nbsp; Alice and Bob take turns erasing exactly one number from the chalkboard, with Alice starting first.&nbsp; If erasing a number causes&nbsp;the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard to become&nbsp;0, then that player loses.&nbsp; (Also, we&#39;ll say the bitwise XOR of one element is that element itself, and the bitwise XOR of no elements is 0.)</p>

<p>Also, if any player starts their turn with the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard equal to 0, then that player wins.</p>

<p>Return True if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Example:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums = [1, 1, 2]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
Alice has two choices: erase 1 or erase 2. 
If she erases 1, the nums array becomes [1, 2]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 2 = 3. Now Bob can remove any element he wants, because Alice will be the one to erase the last element and she will lose. 
If Alice erases 2 first, now nums becomes [1, 1]. The bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 1 XOR 1 = 0. Alice will lose.
