### [Image Smoother](https://leetcode.com/problems/image-smoother)

<p>Given a 2D integer matrix M representing the gray scale of an image, you need to design a smoother to make the gray scale of each cell becomes the average gray scale (rounding down) of all the 8 surrounding cells and itself.  If a cell has less than 8 surrounding cells, then use as many as you can.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
[[1,1,1],
 [1,0,1],
 [1,1,1]]
<b>Output:</b>
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]
<b>Explanation:</b>
For the point (0,0), (0,2), (2,0), (2,2): floor(3/4) = floor(0.75) = 0
For the point (0,1), (1,0), (1,2), (2,1): floor(5/6) = floor(0.83333333) = 0
For the point (1,1): floor(8/9) = floor(0.88888889) = 0
