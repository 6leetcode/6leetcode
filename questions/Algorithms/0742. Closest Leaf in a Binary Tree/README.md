### [Closest Leaf in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-leaf-in-a-binary-tree)

<p>Given a binary tree <b>where every node has a unique value</b>, and a target key <code>k</code>, find the value of the nearest leaf node to target <code>k</code> in the tree.
</p><p>
Here, <i>nearest</i> to a leaf means the least number of edges travelled on the binary tree to reach any leaf of the tree.  Also, a node is called a <i>leaf</i> if it has no children.
</p><p>
In the following examples, the input tree is represented in flattened form row by row.
The actual <code>root</code> tree given will be a TreeNode object.
</p><p>
<b>Example 1:</b>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
root = [1, 3, 2], k = 1
Diagram of binary tree:
          1
         / \
        3   2

<b>Output:</b> 2 (or 3)

<b>Explanation:</b> Either 2 or 3 is the nearest leaf node to the target of 1.
</pre>
</p><p>
<b>Example 2:</b>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
root = [1], k = 1
<b>Output:</b> 1

<b>Explanation:</b> The nearest leaf node is the root node itself.
</pre>
</p>

<p>
<b>Example 3:</b>
<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
root = [1,2,3,4,null,null,null,5,null,6], k = 2
Diagram of binary tree:
             1
            / \
           2   3
          /
         4
        /
       5
      /
     6

<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The leaf node with value 3 (and not the leaf node with value 6) is nearest to the node with value 2.
</pre>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li><code>root</code> represents a binary tree with at least <code>1</code> node and at most <code>1000</code> nodes.</li>
<li>Every node has a unique <code>node.val</code> in range <code>[1, 1000]</code>.</li>
<li>There exists some node in the given binary tree for which <code>node.val == k</code>.</li>
</ol>
