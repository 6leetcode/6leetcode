### [Validate IP Address](https://leetcode.com/problems/validate-ip-address)

<p>
Write a function to check whether an input string is a valid IPv4 address or IPv6 address or neither.
</p>

<p>
<b>IPv4</b> addresses are canonically represented in dot-decimal notation, which consists of four decimal numbers, each ranging from 0 to 255, separated by dots ("."), e.g.,<code>172.16.254.1</code>;
</p>

<p>
Besides, leading zeros in the IPv4 is invalid. For example, the address <code>172.16.254.01</code> is invalid.
</p>

<p>
<b>IPv6</b> addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, each group representing 16 bits. The groups are separated by colons (":"). For example, the address <code>2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code> is a valid one. Also, we could omit some leading zeros among four hexadecimal digits and some low-case characters in the address to upper-case ones, so <code>2001:db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334</code> is also a valid IPv6 address(Omit leading zeros and using upper cases).
</p>


<p>
However, we don't replace a consecutive group of zero value with a single empty group using two consecutive colons (::) to pursue simplicity. For example, <code>2001:0db8:85a3::8A2E:0370:7334</code> is an invalid IPv6 address.
</p>

<p>
Besides, extra leading zeros in the IPv6 is also invalid. For example, the address <code>02001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code> is invalid.
</p>


<p><b>Note:</b>
You may assume there is no extra space or special characters in the input string.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "172.16.254.1"

<b>Output:</b> "IPv4"

<b>Explanation:</b> This is a valid IPv4 address, return "IPv4".
</pre>
</p>


<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:8A2E:0370:7334"

<b>Output:</b> "IPv6"

<b>Explanation:</b> This is a valid IPv6 address, return "IPv6".
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> "256.256.256.256"

<b>Output:</b> "Neither"

<b>Explanation:</b> This is neither a IPv4 address nor a IPv6 address.
