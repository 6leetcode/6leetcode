### [Longest Univalue Path](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-univalue-path)

<p>Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest path where each node in the path has the same value. This path may or may not pass through the root.</p>

<p>The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.</p>
