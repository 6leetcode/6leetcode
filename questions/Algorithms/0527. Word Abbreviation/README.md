### [Word Abbreviation](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-abbreviation)

<p>Given an array of <strong>distinct</strong> strings <code>words</code>, return <em>the minimal possible <strong>abbreviations</strong> for every word</em>.</p>

<p>The following are the rules for a string abbreviation:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Begin with the first character, and then the number of characters abbreviated, followed by the last character.</li>
	<li>If there is any conflict and more than one word shares the same abbreviation, a longer prefix is used instead of only the first character until making the map from word to abbreviation become unique. In other words, a final abbreviation cannot map to more than one original word.</li>
	<li>If the abbreviation does not make the word shorter, then keep it as the original.</li>
</ol>

<strong>Output:</strong> ["aa","aaa"]
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 400</code></li>
	<li><code>2 &lt;= words[i].length &lt;= 400</code></li>
	<li><code>words[i]</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
	<li>All the strings of <code>words</code> are <strong>unique</strong>.</li>
</ul>
