### [Maximum Sum of 3 Non-Overlapping Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-3-non-overlapping-subarrays)

<p>In a given array <code>nums</code> of positive integers, find three non-overlapping subarrays with maximum sum.</p>

<p>Each subarray will be of size <code>k</code>, and we want to maximize the sum of all <code>3*k</code> entries.</p>

<p>Return the result as a list of indices representing the starting position of each interval (0-indexed). If there are multiple answers, return the lexicographically smallest one.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2,1,2,6,7,5,1], 2
<b>Output:</b> [0, 3, 5]
<b>Explanation:</b> Subarrays [1, 2], [2, 6], [7, 5] correspond to the starting indices [0, 3, 5].
We could have also taken [2, 1], but an answer of [1, 3, 5] would be lexicographically larger.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>nums.length</code> will be between 1 and 20000.</li>
	<li><code>nums[i]</code> will be between 1 and 65535.</li>
	<li><code>k</code> will be between 1 and floor(nums.length / 3).</li>
</ul>
