### [Flip Game II](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game-ii)

<p>You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, you and your friend take turns to flip two <b>consecutive</b> <code>&quot;++&quot;</code> into <code>&quot;--&quot;</code>. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.</p>

<p>Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.</p>
