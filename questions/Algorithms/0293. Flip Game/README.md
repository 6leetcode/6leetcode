### [Flip Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game)

<p>You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>, you and your friend take turns to flip two <b>consecutive</b> <code>&quot;++&quot;</code> into <code>&quot;--&quot;</code>. The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.</p>

<p>Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> <code>s = &quot;++++&quot;</code>
<strong>Output:</strong> 
[
  &quot;--++&quot;,
  &quot;+--+&quot;,
  &quot;++--&quot;
]
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>If there is no valid move, return an empty list <code>[]</code>.</p>
