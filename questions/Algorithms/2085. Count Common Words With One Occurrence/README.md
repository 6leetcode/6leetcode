### [Count Common Words With One Occurrence](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-common-words-with-one-occurrence)

<p>Given two string arrays <code>words1</code> and <code>words2</code>, return <em>the number of strings that appear <strong>exactly once</strong> in <b>each</b>&nbsp;of the two arrays.</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words1 = [&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;amazing&quot;,&quot;as&quot;,&quot;is&quot;], words2 = [&quot;amazing&quot;,&quot;leetcode&quot;,&quot;is&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
- &quot;leetcode&quot; appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- &quot;amazing&quot; appears exactly once in each of the two arrays. We count this string.
- &quot;is&quot; appears in each of the two arrays, but there are 2 occurrences of it in words1. We do not count this string.
- &quot;as&quot; appears once in words1, but does not appear in words2. We do not count this string.
Thus, there are 2 strings that appear exactly once in each of the two arrays.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words1 = [&quot;b&quot;,&quot;bb&quot;,&quot;bbb&quot;], words2 = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;aa&quot;,&quot;aaa&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are no strings that appear in each of the two arrays.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> words1 = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;ab&quot;], words2 = [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;ab&quot;]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The only string that appears exactly once in each of the two arrays is &quot;ab&quot;.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words1.length, words2.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= words1[i].length, words2[j].length &lt;= 30</code></li>
	<li><code>words1[i]</code> and <code>words2[j]</code> consists only of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
