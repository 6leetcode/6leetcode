### [Divide Chocolate](https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-chocolate)

<p>You have one chocolate bar that consists of some chunks. Each chunk has its own sweetness given by the array&nbsp;<code>sweetness</code>.</p>

<p>You want to share the chocolate with your <code>K</code>&nbsp;friends so you start cutting the chocolate bar into <code>K+1</code>&nbsp;pieces using&nbsp;<code>K</code>&nbsp;cuts, each piece consists of some <strong>consecutive</strong> chunks.</p>

<p>Being generous, you will eat the piece with the <strong>minimum total sweetness</strong> and give the other pieces to your friends.</p>

<p>Find the <strong>maximum total sweetness</strong> of the&nbsp;piece you can get by cutting the chocolate bar optimally.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sweetness = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], K = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<b>Explanation: </b>You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,3], [4,5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sweetness = [5,6,7,8,9,1,2,3,4], K = 8
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<b>Explanation: </b>There is only one way to cut the bar into 9 pieces.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> sweetness = [1,2,2,1,2,2,1,2,2], K = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 5
<b>Explanation: </b>You can divide the chocolate to [1,2,2], [1,2,2], [1,2,2]
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= K &lt;&nbsp;sweetness.length &lt;= 10^4</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= sweetness[i] &lt;= 10^5</code></li>
</ul>
