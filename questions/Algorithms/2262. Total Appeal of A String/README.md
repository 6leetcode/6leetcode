### [Total Appeal of A String](https://leetcode.com/problems/total-appeal-of-a-string)

<p>The <b>appeal</b> of a string is the number of <strong>distinct</strong> characters found in the string.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For example, the appeal of <code>&quot;abbca&quot;</code> is <code>3</code> because it has <code>3</code> distinct characters: <code>&#39;a&#39;</code>, <code>&#39;b&#39;</code>, and <code>&#39;c&#39;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>, return <em>the <strong>total appeal of all of its <strong>substrings</strong>.</strong></em></p>

<p>A <strong>substring</strong> is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;abbca&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 28
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The following are the substrings of &quot;abbca&quot;:
- Substrings of length 1: &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;a&quot; have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.
- Substrings of length 2: &quot;ab&quot;, &quot;bb&quot;, &quot;bc&quot;, &quot;ca&quot; have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 3: &quot;abb&quot;, &quot;bbc&quot;, &quot;bca&quot; have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 4: &quot;abbc&quot;, &quot;bbca&quot; have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 5: &quot;abbca&quot; has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.
The total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = &quot;code&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> 20
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The following are the substrings of &quot;code&quot;:
- Substrings of length 1: &quot;c&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;e&quot; have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.
- Substrings of length 2: &quot;co&quot;, &quot;od&quot;, &quot;de&quot; have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 3: &quot;cod&quot;, &quot;ode&quot; have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 4: &quot;code&quot; has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.
The total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
