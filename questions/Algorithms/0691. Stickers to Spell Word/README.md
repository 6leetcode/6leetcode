### [Stickers to Spell Word](https://leetcode.com/problems/stickers-to-spell-word)

<p>
We are given N different types of stickers.  Each sticker has a lowercase English word on it.
</p><p>
You would like to spell out the given <code>target</code> string by cutting individual letters from your collection of stickers and rearranging them.
</p><p>
You can use each sticker more than once if you want, and you have infinite quantities of each sticker.
</p><p>
What is the minimum number of stickers that you need to spell out the <code>target</code>?  If the task is impossible, return -1.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>
<p>Input:<pre>
["with", "example", "science"], "thehat"
</pre></p>

<p>Output:<pre>
3
</pre></p>

<p>Explanation:<pre>
We can use 2 "with" stickers, and 1 "example" sticker.
After cutting and rearrange the letters of those stickers, we can form the target "thehat".
Also, this is the minimum number of stickers necessary to form the target string.
</pre></p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>
<p>Input:<pre>
["notice", "possible"], "basicbasic"
</pre></p>

<p>Output:<pre>
-1
</pre></p>

<p>Explanation:<pre>
We can't form the target "basicbasic" from cutting letters from the given stickers.
</pre></p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
<li><code>stickers</code> has length in the range <code>[1, 50]</code>.</li>
<li><code>stickers</code> consists of lowercase English words (without apostrophes).</li>
<li><code>target</code> has length in the range <code>[1, 15]</code>, and consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
<li>In all test cases, all words were chosen <u>randomly</u> from the 1000 most common US English words, and the target was chosen as a concatenation of two random words.</li>
<li>The time limit may be more challenging than usual.  It is expected that a 50 sticker test case can be solved within 35ms on average.</li>
