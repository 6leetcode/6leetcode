### [Generalized Abbreviation](https://leetcode.com/problems/generalized-abbreviation)

<p>A word&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>generalized abbreviation</strong>&nbsp;can be constructed by taking any number of non-overlapping substrings and replacing them with their respective lengths. For example, <code>&quot;abcde&quot;</code> can be abbreviated into <code>&quot;a3e&quot;</code> (<code>&quot;bcd&quot;</code> turned into <code>&quot;3&quot;</code>), <code>&quot;1bcd1&quot;</code> (<code>&quot;a&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;e&quot;</code> both turned into <code>&quot;1&quot;</code>), and <code>&quot;23&quot;</code> (<code>&quot;ab&quot;</code> turned into <code>&quot;2&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;cde&quot;</code> turned into <code>&quot;3&quot;</code>).</p>

<p>Given a string <code>word</code>, return <em>a list of all the possible <strong>generalized abbreviations</strong> of</em> <code>word</code>. Return the answer in <strong>any order</strong>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> word = "word"
<strong>Output:</strong> ["4","3d","2r1","2rd","1o2","1o1d","1or1","1ord","w3","w2d","w1r1","w1rd","wo2","wo1d","wor1","word"]
</pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> word = "a"
<strong>Output:</strong> ["1","a"]
</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= word.length &lt;= 15</code></li>
	<li><code>word</code> consists of only lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
