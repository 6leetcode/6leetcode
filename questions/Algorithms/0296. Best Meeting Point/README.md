### [Best Meeting Point](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-meeting-point)

<p>A group of two or more people wants to meet and minimize the total travel distance. You are given a 2D grid of values 0 or 1, where each 1 marks the home of someone in the group. The distance is calculated using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry" target="_blank">Manhattan Distance</a>, where distance(p1, p2) = <code>|p2.x - p1.x| + |p2.y - p1.y|</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> 

1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0

<strong>Output: 6 

Explanation: </strong>Given three people living at <code>(0,0)</code>, <code>(0,4)</code>, and <code>(2,2)</code>:
&nbsp;            The point <code>(0,2)</code> is an ideal meeting point, as the total travel distance 
&nbsp;            of 2+2+2=6 is minimal. So return 6.</pre>
