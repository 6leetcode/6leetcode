### [Magical String](https://leetcode.com/problems/magical-string)

<p>
A magical string <b>S</b> consists of only '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:
</p>
<p>
The string <b>S</b> is magical because concatenating the number of contiguous occurrences of characters '1' and '2' generates the string <b>S</b> itself.
</p>

<p>
The first few elements of string <b>S</b> is the following:
<b>S</b> = "1221121221221121122……"
</p>

<p>
If we group the consecutive '1's and '2's in <b>S</b>, it will be:
</p>
<p>
1   22  11  2  1  22  1  22  11  2  11  22 ......
</p>
<p>
and the occurrences of '1's or '2's in each group are:
</p>
<p>
1   2	   2    1   1    2     1    2     2    1    2    2 ......
</p>

<p>
You can see that the occurrence sequence above is the <b>S</b> itself. 
</p>

<p>
Given an integer N as input, return the number of '1's in the first N number in the magical string <b>S</b>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
N will not exceed 100,000.
</p>


<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 6
<b>Output:</b> 3
<b>Explanation:</b> The first 6 elements of magical string S is "12211" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
