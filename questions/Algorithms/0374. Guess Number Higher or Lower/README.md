### [Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://leetcode.com/problems/guess-number-higher-or-lower)

<p>We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:</p>

<p>I pick a number from <b>1</b> to <b><i>n</i></b>. You have to guess which number I picked.</p>

<p>Every time you guess wrong, I&#39;ll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.</p>

<p>You call a pre-defined API <code>guess(int num)</code> which returns 3 possible results (<code>-1</code>, <code>1</code>, or <code>0</code>):</p>

<pre>
-1 : My number is lower
 1 : My number is higher
 0 : Congrats! You got it!
</pre>

<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>

<div>
<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong>n = <span id="example-input-1-1">10</span>, pick = <span id="example-input-1-2">6</span>
<strong>Output: </strong><span id="example-output-1">6</span>
</pre>
</div>
