### [Statistics from a Large Sample](https://leetcode.com/problems/statistics-from-a-large-sample)

<p>We sampled integers in the range <code>[0, 255]</code> and stored the results in an array count where <code>count[k]</code> is the number of integers we sampled equal to <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the sample respectively, as an array of floating-point numbers</em>. Answers within <code>10<sup>-5</sup></code> of the actual answer will be considered accepted.</p>

<p>The mode is guaranteed to be unique.</p>

<p>The <strong>median of a sample</strong> is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The middle element, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is odd, or</li>
	<li>The average of the middle two elements, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is even.</li>
</ul>
