### [Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words)

<p>In English, we have a concept called <strong>root</strong>, which can be followed by some other word&nbsp;to form another longer word - let&#39;s call this word <strong>successor</strong>. For example, when the <strong>root</strong> <code>&quot;an&quot;</code> is&nbsp;followed by the <strong>successor</strong>&nbsp;word&nbsp;<code>&quot;other&quot;</code>, we&nbsp;can form a new word <code>&quot;another&quot;</code>.</p>

<p>Given a <code>dictionary</code> consisting of many <strong>roots</strong> and a <code>sentence</code>&nbsp;consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the <strong>successors</strong> in the sentence with the <strong>root</strong> forming it. If a <strong>successor</strong> can be replaced by more than one <strong>root</strong>,&nbsp;replace it with the <strong>root</strong> that has&nbsp;<strong>the shortest length</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the <code>sentence</code></em> after the replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
<strong>Output:</strong> "the cat was rat by the bat"
</pre><p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dictionary = ["a","b","c"], sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"
<strong>Output:</strong> "a a b c"
</pre><p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"], sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"
<strong>Output:</strong> "a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"
</pre><p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dictionary = ["catt","cat","bat","rat"], sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"
<strong>Output:</strong> "the cat was rat by the bat"
</pre><p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> dictionary = ["ac","ab"], sentence = "it is abnormal that this solution is accepted"
<strong>Output:</strong> "it is ab that this solution is ac"
