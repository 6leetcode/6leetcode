### [Can Place Flowers](https://leetcode.com/problems/can-place-flowers)

<p>Suppose you have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in adjacent plots - they would compete for water and both would die.</p>

<p>Given a flowerbed (represented as an array containing 0 and 1, where 0 means empty and 1 means not empty), and a number <b>n</b>, return if <b>n</b> new flowers can be planted in it without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
<b>Output:</b> True
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
<b>Output:</b> False
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The input array won't violate no-adjacent-flowers rule.</li>
<li>The input array size is in the range of [1, 20000].</li>
<li><b>n</b> is a non-negative integer which won't exceed the input array size.</li>
</ol>
