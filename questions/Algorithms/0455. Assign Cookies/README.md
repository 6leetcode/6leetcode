### [Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies)

<p>
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor g<sub>i</sub>, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s<sub>j</sub>. If s<sub>j</sub> >= g<sub>i</sub>, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. <br />
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2,3], [1,1]

<b>Output:</b> 1

<b>Explanation:</b> You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. 
And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
You need to output 1.

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,2], [1,2,3]

<b>Output:</b> 2

<b>Explanation:</b> You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 children are 1, 2. 
You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the children, 
You need to output 2.
