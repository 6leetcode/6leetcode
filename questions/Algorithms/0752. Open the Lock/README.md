### [Open the Lock](https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock)

<p>
You have a lock in front of you with 4 circular wheels.  Each wheel has 10 slots: <code>'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'</code>.  The wheels can rotate freely and wrap around: for example we can turn <code>'9'</code> to be <code>'0'</code>, or <code>'0'</code> to be <code>'9'</code>.  Each move consists of turning one wheel one slot.
</p><p>
The lock initially starts at <code>'0000'</code>, a string representing the state of the 4 wheels.
</p><p>
You are given a list of <code>deadends</code> dead ends, meaning if the lock displays any of these codes, the wheels of the lock will stop turning and you will be unable to open it.
</p><p>
Given a <code>target</code> representing the value of the wheels that will unlock the lock, return the minimum total number of turns required to open the lock, or -1 if it is impossible.

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> deadends = ["0201","0101","0102","1212","2002"], target = "0202"
<b>Output:</b> 6
<b>Explanation:</b>
A sequence of valid moves would be "0000" -> "1000" -> "1100" -> "1200" -> "1201" -> "1202" -> "0202".
Note that a sequence like "0000" -> "0001" -> "0002" -> "0102" -> "0202" would be invalid,
because the wheels of the lock become stuck after the display becomes the dead end "0102".
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> deadends = ["8888"], target = "0009"
<b>Output:</b> 1
<b>Explanation:</b>
We can turn the last wheel in reverse to move from "0000" -> "0009".
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> deadends = ["8887","8889","8878","8898","8788","8988","7888","9888"], target = "8888"
<b>Output:</b> -1
<b>Explanation:</b>
We can't reach the target without getting stuck.

<p><b>Example 4:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> deadends = ["0000"], target = "8888"
<b>Output:</b> -1

<ol>
<li>The length of <code>deadends</code> will be in the range <code>[1, 500]</code>.</li>
<li><code>target</code> will not be in the list <code>deadends</code>.</li>
<li>Every string in <code>deadends</code> and the string <code>target</code> will be a string of 4 digits from the 10,000 possibilities <code>'0000'</code> to <code>'9999'</code>.</li>
