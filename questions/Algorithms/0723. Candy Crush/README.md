### [Candy Crush](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy-crush)

<p>This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.</p>

<p>Given a 2D integer array <code>board</code> representing the grid of candy, different positive integers <code>board[i][j]</code> represent different types of candies. A value of <code>board[i][j] = 0</code> represents that the cell at position <code>(i, j)</code> is empty. The given board represents the state of the game following the player&#39;s move. Now, you need to restore the board to a <i>stable state</i> by crushing candies according to the following rules:</p>

<ol>
	<li>If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, &quot;crush&quot; them all at the same time - these positions become empty.</li>
	<li>After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. (No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.)</li>
	<li>After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.</li>
	<li>If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (ie. the board is <i>stable</i>), then return the current board.</li>
</ol>

<p>You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return the current board.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre style="white-space: pre-line">
<b>Input:</b>
board = 
[[110,5,112,113,114],[210,211,5,213,214],[310,311,3,313,314],[410,411,412,5,414],[5,1,512,3,3],[610,4,1,613,614],[710,1,2,713,714],[810,1,2,1,1],[1,1,2,2,2],[4,1,4,4,1014]]

<b>Output:</b>
[[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0],[110,0,0,0,114],[210,0,0,0,214],[310,0,0,113,314],[410,0,0,213,414],[610,211,112,313,614],[710,311,412,613,714],[810,411,512,713,1014]]

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ol>
	<li>The length of <code>board</code> will be in the range [3, 50].</li>
	<li>The length of <code>board[i]</code> will be in the range [3, 50].</li>
	<li>Each <code>board[i][j]</code> will initially start as an integer in the range [1, 2000].</li>
