### [Candy Crush](https://leetcode.com/problems/candy-crush)

<p>This question is about implementing a basic elimination algorithm for Candy Crush.</p>

<p>Given an <code>m x n</code> integer array <code>board</code> representing the grid of candy where <code>board[i][j]</code> represents the type of candy. A value of <code>board[i][j] == 0</code> represents that the cell is empty.</p>

<p>The given board represents the state of the game following the player&#39;s move. Now, you need to restore the board to a stable state by crushing candies according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If three or more candies of the same type are adjacent vertically or horizontally, crush them all at the same time - these positions become empty.</li>
	<li>After crushing all candies simultaneously, if an empty space on the board has candies on top of itself, then these candies will drop until they hit a candy or bottom at the same time. No new candies will drop outside the top boundary.</li>
	<li>After the above steps, there may exist more candies that can be crushed. If so, you need to repeat the above steps.</li>
	<li>If there does not exist more candies that can be crushed (i.e., the board is stable), then return the current board.</li>
</ul>

<p>You need to perform the above rules until the board becomes stable, then return <em>the stable board</em>.</p>
