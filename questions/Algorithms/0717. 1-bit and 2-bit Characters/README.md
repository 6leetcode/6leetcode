### [1-bit and 2-bit Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters)

<p>We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit <code>0</code>. The second character can be represented by two bits (<code>10</code> or <code>11</code>).  </p>

<p>Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
<b>Output:</b> True
<b>Explanation:</b> 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
<b>Output:</b> False
<b>Explanation:</b> 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
<li><code>1 <= len(bits) <= 1000</code>.</li>
<li><code>bits[i]</code> is always <code>0</code> or <code>1</code>.</li>
