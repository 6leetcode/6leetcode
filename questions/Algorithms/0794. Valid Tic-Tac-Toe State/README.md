### [Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-tic-tac-toe-state)

<p>A Tic-Tac-Toe board is given as a string array <code>board</code>. Return True if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.</p>

<p>The <code>board</code> is a 3 x 3 array, and consists of characters <code>&quot; &quot;</code>, <code>&quot;X&quot;</code>, and <code>&quot;O&quot;</code>.&nbsp; The &quot; &quot; character represents an empty square.</p>

<p>Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Players take turns placing characters into empty squares (&quot; &quot;).</li>
	<li>The first player always places &quot;X&quot; characters, while the second player always places &quot;O&quot; characters.</li>
	<li>&quot;X&quot; and &quot;O&quot; characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.</li>
	<li>The game ends when there are 3 of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.</li>
	<li>The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.</li>
	<li>No more moves can be played if the game is over.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><code>board</code> is a length-3 array of strings, where each string <code>board[i]</code> has length 3.</li>
	<li>Each <code>board[i][j]</code> is a character in the set <code>{&quot; &quot;, &quot;X&quot;, &quot;O&quot;}</code>.</li>
</ul>
