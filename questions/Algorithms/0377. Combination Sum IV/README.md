### [Combination Sum IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv)

<p>Given an integer array with all positive numbers and no duplicates, find the number of possible combinations that add up to a positive integer target.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
<i><b>nums</b></i> = [1, 2, 3]
<i><b>target</b></i> = 4

The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)

Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.

Therefore the output is <i><b>7</b></i>.
