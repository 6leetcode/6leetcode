### [License Key Formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting)

<p>You are given a license key represented as a string S which consists only alphanumeric character and dashes. The string is separated into N+1 groups by N dashes.</p>

<p>Given a number K, we would want to reformat the strings such that each group contains <i>exactly</i> K characters, except for the first group which could be shorter than K, but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.</p>

<p>Given a non-empty string S and a number K, format the string according to the rules described above.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4

<b>Output:</b> "5F3Z-2E9W"

<b>Explanation:</b> The string S has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
</pre>
</p>


<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2

<b>Output:</b> "2-5G-3J"

<b>Explanation:</b> The string S has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The length of string S will not exceed 12,000, and K is a positive integer.</li>
<li>String S consists only of alphanumerical characters (a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9) and dashes(-).</li>
<li>String S is non-empty.</li>
</ol>
