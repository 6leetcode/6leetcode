### [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-with-transaction-fee)

<p>Your are given an array of integers <code>prices</code>, for which the <code>i</code>-th element is the price of a given stock on day <code>i</code>; and a non-negative integer <code>fee</code> representing a transaction fee.</p>
<p>You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.  You may not buy more than 1 share of a stock at a time (ie. you must sell the stock share before you buy again.)</p>
<p>Return the maximum profit you can make.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> prices = [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 9], fee = 2
<b>Output:</b> 8
<b>Explanation:</b> The maximum profit can be achieved by:
<li>Buying at prices[0] = 1</li><li>Selling at prices[3] = 8</li><li>Buying at prices[4] = 4</li><li>Selling at prices[5] = 9</li>The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
<li><code>0 < prices.length <= 50000</code>.</li>
<li><code>0 < prices[i] < 50000</code>.</li>
<li><code>0 <= fee < 50000</code>.</li>
