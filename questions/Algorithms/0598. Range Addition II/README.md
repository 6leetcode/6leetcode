### [Range Addition II](https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii)

<p>Given an m * n matrix <b>M</b> initialized with all <b>0</b>'s and several update operations.</p>
<p>Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two <b>positive</b> integers <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, which means <b>M[i][j]</b> should be <b>added by one</b> for all <b>0 <= i < a</b> and <b>0 <= j < b</b>. </p>
<p>You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The range of m and n is [1,40000].</li>
<li>The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].</li>
<li>The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.</li>
</ol>
