### [Capitalize the Title](https://leetcode.com/problems/capitalize-the-title)

<p>You are given a string <code>title</code> consisting of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. <strong>Capitalize</strong> the string by changing the capitalization of each word such that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the length of the word is <code>1</code> or <code>2</code> letters, change all letters to lowercase.</li>
	<li>Otherwise, change the first letter to uppercase and the remaining letters to lowercase.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <em>the <strong>capitalized</strong> </em><code>title</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> title = &quot;capiTalIze tHe titLe&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;Capitalize The Title&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
Since all the words have a length of at least 3, the first letter of each word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> title = &quot;First leTTeR of EACH Word&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;First Letter of Each Word&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The word &quot;of&quot; has length 2, so it is all lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> title = &quot;i lOve leetcode&quot;
<strong>Output:</strong> &quot;i Love Leetcode&quot;
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The word &quot;i&quot; has length 1, so it is lowercase.
The remaining words have a length of at least 3, so the first letter of each remaining word is uppercase, and the remaining letters are lowercase.
