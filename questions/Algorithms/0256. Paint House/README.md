### [Paint House](https://leetcode.com/problems/paint-house)

<p>There are a row of <i>n</i> houses, each house can be painted with one of the three colors: red, blue or green. The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color.</p>

<p>The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a <code><i>n</i> x <i>3</i></code> cost matrix. For example, <code>costs[0][0]</code> is the cost of painting house 0 with color red; <code>costs[1][2]</code> is the cost of painting house 1 with color green, and so on... Find the minimum cost to paint all houses.</p>
