### [Number Complement](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement)

<p>Given a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>num</code>, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> num = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> num = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The given integer <code>num</code> is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.</li>
	<li><code>num &gt;= 1</code></li>
	<li>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer&rsquo;s binary representation.</li>
