### [Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves)

<p>We have a sequence of <code>books</code>: the <code>i</code>-th book has thickness <code>books[i][0]</code> and height <code>books[i][1]</code>.</p>

<p>We want to place these books <strong>in order</strong>&nbsp;onto bookcase shelves that have total width <code>shelf_width</code>.</p>

<p>We choose&nbsp;some of the books to place on this shelf (such that the sum of their thickness is <code>&lt;= shelf_width</code>), then build another level of shelf of the bookcase so that the total height of the bookcase has increased by the maximum height of the books we just put down.&nbsp; We repeat this process until there are no more books to place.</p>

<p>Note again that at each step of the above&nbsp;process, <u>the order of the books we place is the same order as the given sequence of books</u>.&nbsp; For example, if we have an ordered list of 5&nbsp;books, we might place the first and second book onto the first shelf, the third book on the second shelf, and the fourth and fifth book on the last shelf.</p>

<p>Return the minimum possible height that the total bookshelf can be after placing shelves in this manner.</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/06/24/shelves.png" style="width: 250px; height: 370px;" />
<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> books = [[1,1],[2,3],[2,3],[1,1],[1,1],[1,1],[1,2]], shelf_width = 4
<strong>Output:</strong> 6
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The sum of the heights of the 3 shelves are 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
Notice that book number 2 does not have to be on the first shelf.
</pre>

<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= books.length &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= books[i][0] &lt;= shelf_width &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= books[i][1] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
</ul>
