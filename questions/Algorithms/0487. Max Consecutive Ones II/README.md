### [Max Consecutive Ones II](https://leetcode.com/problems/max-consecutive-ones-ii)

<p>
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array if you can flip at most one 0.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,0,1,1,0]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
    After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li>The input array will only contain <code>0</code> and <code>1</code>.</li>
<li>The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>Follow up:</b><br />
What if the input numbers come in one by one as an <b>infinite stream</b>? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?
