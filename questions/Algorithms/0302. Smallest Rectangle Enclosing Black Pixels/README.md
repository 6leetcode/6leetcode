### [Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-rectangle-enclosing-black-pixels)

<p>An image is represented by a binary matrix with <code>0</code> as a white pixel and <code>1</code> as a black pixel. The black pixels are connected, i.e., there is only one black region. Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically. Given the location <code>(x, y)</code> of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
[
  &quot;0010&quot;,
  &quot;0110&quot;,
  &quot;0100&quot;
]
and <code>x = 0<font face="sans-serif, Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS">, </font></code><code>y = 2</code>
