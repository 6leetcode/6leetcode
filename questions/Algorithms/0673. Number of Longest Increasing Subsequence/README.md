### [Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-longest-increasing-subsequence)

<p>
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of longest increasing subsequence.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,3,5,4,7]
<b>Output:</b> 2
<b>Explanation:</b> The two longest increasing subsequence are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [2,2,2,2,2]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1, and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b>
Length of the given array will be not exceed 2000 and the answer is guaranteed to be fit in 32-bit signed int.
