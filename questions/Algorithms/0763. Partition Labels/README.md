### [Partition Labels](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-labels)

<p>A string <code>s</code> of lowercase English letters is given. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> s = &quot;ababcbacadefegdehijhklij&quot;
<b>Output:</b> [9,7,8]
<b>Explanation:</b>
The partition is &quot;ababcbaca&quot;, &quot;defegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot;.
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like &quot;ababcbacadefegde&quot;, &quot;hijhklij&quot; is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Note:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>s</code> will have length in range <code>[1, 500]</code>.</li>
	<li><code>s</code> will consist of lowercase English letters (<code>&#39;a&#39;</code> to <code>&#39;z&#39;</code>) only.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
