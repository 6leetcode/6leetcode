### [Find the Closest Palindrome](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-closest-palindrome)

<p>Given an integer n, find the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. </p>

<p>The 'closest' is defined as absolute difference minimized between two integers.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
