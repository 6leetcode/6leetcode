### [Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock-iv)

<p>Say you have an array for which the <i>i<span style="font-size: 10.8333px;">-</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.8333px;">th</span>&nbsp;element is the price of a given stock on day <i>i</i>.</p>

<p>Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most <b>k</b> transactions.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [2,4,1], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 7
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4.
&nbsp;            Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
</pre>
