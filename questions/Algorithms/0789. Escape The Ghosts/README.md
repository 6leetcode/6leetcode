### [Escape The Ghosts](https://leetcode.com/problems/escape-the-ghosts)

<p>You are playing a simplified Pacman game. You&nbsp;start at the point <code>(0, 0)</code>, and your destination is<code> (target[0], target[1])</code>. There are several ghosts on the map, the i-th ghost starts at<code> (ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1])</code>.</p>

<p>Each turn, you and all ghosts simultaneously *may* move in one of 4 cardinal directions: north, east, west, or south, going from the previous point to a new point 1 unit of distance away.</p>

<p>You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghost reaches you (for any given moves the ghosts may take.)&nbsp; If you reach any square (including the target) at the same time as a ghost, it doesn&#39;t count as an escape.</p>

<p>Return True if and only if it is possible to escape.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Example 1:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
ghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]]
target = [0, 1]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
You can directly reach the destination (0, 1) at time 1, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) or (0, 3) have no way to catch up with you.
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>Example 2:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
ghosts = [[1, 0]]
target = [2, 0]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>Example 3:</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
ghosts = [[2, 0]]
target = [1, 0]
<strong>Output:</strong> false
<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>All points have coordinates with absolute value &lt;= <code>10000</code>.</li>
	<li>The number of ghosts will not exceed <code>100</code>.</li>
</ul>
