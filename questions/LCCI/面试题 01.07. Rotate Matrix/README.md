### [Rotate Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-matrix-lcci)

<p>Given an image represented by an N x N matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given <strong>matrix</strong> = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

Rotate the matrix <strong>in place. </strong>It becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
</pre>

<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given <strong>matrix</strong> =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

Rotate the matrix <strong>in place. </strong>It becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
</pre>
