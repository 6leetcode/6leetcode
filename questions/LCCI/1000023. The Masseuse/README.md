### [The Masseuse](https://leetcode.com/problems/the-masseuse-lcci)

She needs a break between appointments and therefore she cannot accept any adjacent requests. Given a sequence of back-to-back appoint&shy; ment requests, find the optimal (highest total booked minutes) set the masseuse can honor. Return the number of minutes.</p>
