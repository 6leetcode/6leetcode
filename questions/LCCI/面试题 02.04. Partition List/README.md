### [Partition List](https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-list-lcci)

<p>Write code to partition a linked list around a value x, such that all nodes less than x come before all nodes greater than or equal to x. If x is contained within the list, the values of x only need to be after the elements less than x (see below). The partition element x can appear anywhere in the &quot;right partition&quot;; it does not need to appear between the left and right partitions.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> head = 3-&gt;5-&gt;8-&gt;5-&gt;10-&gt;2-&gt;1, <em>x</em> = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 3-&gt;1-&gt;2-&gt;10-&gt;5-&gt;5-&gt;8
</pre>
