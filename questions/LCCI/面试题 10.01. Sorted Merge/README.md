### [Sorted Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/sorted-merge-lcci)

<p>You are given two sorted arrays, A and B, where A has a large enough buffer at the end to hold B. Write a method to merge B into A in sorted order.</p>

<p>Initially the number of elements in A and B are&nbsp;<em>m</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>n</em> respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong>
A = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3
B = [2,5,6],       n = 3

<strong>Output:</strong>&nbsp;[1,2,2,3,5,6]</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>A.length == n + m</code></li>
</ul>
