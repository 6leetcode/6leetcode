### [BST Sequences](https://leetcode.com/problems/bst-sequences-lcci)

<p>A binary search tree was created by traversing through an array from left to right and inserting each element. Given a binary search tree with distinct elements, print all possible arrays that could have led to this tree.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Given the following tree:</p>

<pre>
        2
       / \
      1   3
</pre>

<p>Output:</p>
