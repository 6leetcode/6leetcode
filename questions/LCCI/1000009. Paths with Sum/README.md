### [Paths with Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/paths-with-sum-lcci)

<p>You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value (which might be positive or negative). Design an algorithm to count the number of paths that sum to a given value. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Given the following tree and &nbsp;<code>sum = 22,</code></p>

<pre>
              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \    / \
        7    2  5   1
</pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre>
3
<strong>Explanation: </strong>Paths that have sum 22 are: [5,4,11,2], [5,8,4,5], [4,11,7]</pre>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
	<li><code>node number &lt;= 10000</code></li>
</ul>
