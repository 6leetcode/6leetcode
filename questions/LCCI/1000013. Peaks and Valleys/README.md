### [Peaks and Valleys](https://leetcode.com/problems/peaks-and-valleys-lcci)

<p>In an array of integers, a &quot;peak&quot; is an element which is greater than or equal to the adjacent integers and a &quot;valley&quot; is an element which is less than or equal to the adjacent inte&shy;gers. For example, in the array {5, 8, 4, 2, 3, 4, 6}, {8, 6} are peaks and {5, 2} are valleys. Given an array of integers, sort the array into an alternating sequence of peaks and valleys.</p>
