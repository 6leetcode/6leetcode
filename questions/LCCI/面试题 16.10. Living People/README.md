### [Living People](https://leetcode.com/problems/living-people-lcci)

<p>Given a list of people with their birth and death years, implement a method to compute the year with the most number of people alive. You may assume that all people were born between 1900 and 2000 (inclusive). If a person was alive during any portion of that year, they should be included in that year&#39;s count. For example, Person (birth= 1908, death= 1909) is included in the counts for both 1908 and 1909.</p>

<p>If there are more than one years&nbsp;that have the most number of people alive, return the smallest one.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong>
birth = {1900, 1901, 1950}
death = {1948, 1951, 2000}
<strong>Output: </strong> 1901
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>0 &lt; birth.length == death.length &lt;= 10000</code></li>
	<li><code>birth[i] &lt;= death[i]</code></li>
</ul>
