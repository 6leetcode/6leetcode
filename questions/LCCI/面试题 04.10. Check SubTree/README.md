### [Check SubTree](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-subtree-lcci)

<p>T1&nbsp;and T2 are two very large binary trees, with T1&nbsp;much bigger than T2. Create an algorithm to determine if T2 is a subtree of T1.</p>

<p>A tree T2 is a subtree of T1&nbsp;if there exists a node n in T1&nbsp;such that the subtree of n is identical to T2. That is, if you cut off the tree at node n, the two trees would be identical.</p>

<p><strong>Example1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong> Input</strong>: t1 = [1, 2, 3], t2 = [2]
<strong> Output</strong>: true
</pre>

<p><strong>Example2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong> Input</strong>: t1 = [1, null, 2, 4], t2 = [3, 2]
<strong> Output</strong>: false
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The node numbers of both tree are in [0, 20000].</li>
</ol>
