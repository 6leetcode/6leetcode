### [Contiguous Sequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/contiguous-sequence-lcci)

<p>You are given an array of integers (both positive and negative). Find the contiguous sequence with the largest sum. Return the sum.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input: </strong> [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
<strong>Output: </strong> 6
<strong>Explanation: </strong> [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum 6.
</pre>

<p><strong>Follow Up: </strong></p>

<p>If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.</p>
