### [Shortest Distance in a Plane](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-in-a-plane)

Table <code>point_2d</code> holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Note:</b> The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.
