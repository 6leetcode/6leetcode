<p>In facebook, there is a <code>follow</code> table with two columns: <b>followee</b>, <b>follower</b>.</p>

<p>Please write a sql query to get the amount of each follower&rsquo;s follower if he/she has one.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
+-------------+------------+
| followee    | follower   |
+-------------+------------+
|     A       |     B      |
|     B       |     C      |
|     B       |     D      |
|     D       |     E      |
+-------------+------------+
</pre>
should output:

<pre>
+-------------+------------+
| follower    | num        |
+-------------+------------+
|     B       |  2         |
|     D       |  1         |
+-------------+------------+
</pre>
<b>Explaination:</b><br />
Both B and D exist in the follower list, when as a followee, B&#39;s follower is C and D, and D&#39;s follower is E. A does not exist in follower list.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Note:</b><br />

Please display the result in follower&#39;s alphabet order.
