<p>Table:&nbsp;<code>Players</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| player_id   | int   |
| group_id    | int   |
+-------------+-------+
player_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the group of each player.
</pre>

<p>Table:&nbsp;<code>Matches</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| first_player  | int     |
| second_player | int     | 
| first_score   | int     |
| second_score  | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a match, first_player and second_player contain the player_id of each match.
first_score and second_score contain the number of points of the first_player and second_player respectively.
You may assume that, in each match, players belongs to the same group.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The winner in each group is the player who scored the maximum total points within the group.&nbsp;In the case of a tie, the <strong>lowest</strong> player_id&nbsp;wins.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the winner in each group.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>
<code>Players </code>table:
+-----------+------------+
| player_id | group_id   |
+-----------+------------+
| 15        | 1          |
| 25        | 1          |
| 30        | 1          |
| 45        | 1          |
| 10        | 2          |
