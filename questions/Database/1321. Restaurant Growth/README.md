### [Restaurant Growth](https://leetcode.com/problems/restaurant-growth)

<p>Table: <code>Customer</code></p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| customer_id   | int     |
| name          | varchar |
| visited_on    | date    |
| amount        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
(customer_id, visited_on) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains data about customer transactions in a restaurant.
visited_on is the date on which the customer with ID (customer_id) have visited the restaurant.
amount is the total paid by a customer.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are the restaurant owner and you want to analyze a possible expansion (there will be at least one customer every day).</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to compute moving average of how much customer paid in a 7 days window (current day + 6&nbsp;days before) .</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<p>Return result table ordered by visited_on.</p>

<p><code>average_amount&nbsp;</code>should be&nbsp;<strong>rounded to 2 decimal places</strong>, all dates are in the format (&#39;YYYY-MM-DD&#39;).</p>

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| visited_on   | amount       | average_amount |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+
| 2019-01-07   | 860          | 122.86         |
| 2019-01-08   | 840          | 120            |

| 2019-01-10   | 1000         | 142.86         |
+--------------+--------------+----------------+

1st moving average from 2019-01-01 to 2019-01-07 has an average_amount of (100 + 110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150)/7 = 122.86
2nd moving average from 2019-01-02 to 2019-01-08 has an average_amount of (110 + 120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80)/7 = 120
3rd moving average from 2019-01-03 to 2019-01-09 has an average_amount of (120 + 130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110)/7 = 120
4th moving average from 2019-01-04 to 2019-01-10 has an average_amount of (130 + 110 + 140 + 150 + 80 + 110 + 130 + 150)/7 = 142.86
