| 1          | keyboard     | 120   |
| 2          | mouse        | 80    |

| 4          | hard disk    | 450   |
+------------+--------------+-------+

Result table:
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| product_name | product_id | order_id | order_date |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
| keyboard     | 1          | 6        | 2020-08-01 |

| screen       | 3          | 3        | 2020-08-29 |
+--------------+------------+----------+------------+
keyboard&#39;s most recent order is in 2020-08-01, it was ordered two times this day.
mouse&#39;s most recent order is in 2020-08-03, it was ordered only once this day.
screen&#39;s most recent order is in 2020-08-29, it was ordered only once this day.
The hard disk was never ordered and we don&#39;t include it in the result table.
