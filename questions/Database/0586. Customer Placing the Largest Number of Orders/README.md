|-------------------|-----------|
| order_number (PK) | int       |
| customer_number   | int       |
| order_date        | date      |
| required_date     | date      |
| shipped_date      | date      |

| comment           | char(200) |
</pre>

<p><b>Sample Input</b></p>

<pre>
| order_number | customer_number | order_date | required_date | shipped_date | status | comment |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|---------------|--------------|--------|---------|
| 1            | 1               | 2017-04-09 | 2017-04-13    | 2017-04-12   | Closed |         |

</pre>

<p><b>Sample Output</b></p>

<pre>
| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
</pre>

<p><b>Explanation</b></p>

<pre>
The customer with number &#39;3&#39; has two orders, which is greater than either customer &#39;1&#39; or &#39;2&#39; because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number &#39;3&#39;.
</pre>

<p><i><b>Follow up:</b> What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?</i></p>
