<p>Write an SQL query that reports the number of posts reported yesterday for each report reason. Assume today is <strong>2019-07-05</strong>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-04  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Result table:
+---------------+--------------+
| report_reason | report_count |
+---------------+--------------+
| spam          | 1            |
| racism        | 2            |
+---------------+--------------+ 
Note that we only care about report reasons with non zero number of reports.</pre>
