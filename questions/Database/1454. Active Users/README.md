### [Active Users](https://leetcode.com/problems/active-users)

<p>Table <code>Accounts</code>:</p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
the id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Table <code>Logins</code>:</p>

<pre>
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.</p>

<p>Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for 5 or more consecutive days.</p>

<p>Return the result table <strong>ordered</strong> by the id.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+

Result table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user.
</pre>

<p><strong>Follow up question:</strong><br />
Can you write a general solution if the active&nbsp;users are those who logged in to their accounts for <code>n</code> or more consecutive days?</p>
