<p>Write an SQL query to report the following statistics for each month of <strong>2020</strong>:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The number of drivers currently with the Hopper company by the end of the month (<code>active_drivers</code>).</li>
	<li>The number of accepted rides in that month (<code>accepted_rides</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>month</code> in ascending order, where <code>month</code> is the month&#39;s number (January is <code>1</code>, February is <code>2</code>, etc.).</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example.</p>
