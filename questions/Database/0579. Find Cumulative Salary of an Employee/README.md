<p>Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee&#39;s salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month.</p>

<p>The result should be displayed by &#39;Id&#39; ascending, and then by &#39;Month&#39; descending.</p>

<p><b>Example</b><br />
<b>Input</b></p>

<pre>
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 1  | 2     | 30     |
| 2  | 2     | 30     |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
| 1  | 3     | 40     |
| 3  | 3     | 60     |
| 1  | 4     | 60     |
| 3  | 4     | 70     |
</pre>
<b>Output</b>

<pre>

| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>Explanation</b>

<p>Employee &#39;1&#39; has 3 salary records for the following 3 months except the most recent month &#39;4&#39;: salary 40 for month &#39;3&#39;, 30 for month &#39;2&#39; and 20 for month &#39;1&#39;<br />
So the cumulative sum of salary of this employee over 3 months is 90(40+30+20), 50(30+20) and 20 respectively.</p>

<pre>
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 1  | 3     | 90     |
| 1  | 2     | 50     |
| 1  | 1     | 20     |
</pre>
Employee &#39;2&#39; only has one salary record (month &#39;1&#39;) except its most recent month &#39;2&#39;.

<pre>
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 2  | 1     | 20     |
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
Employ &#39;3&#39; has two salary records except its most recent pay month &#39;4&#39;: month &#39;3&#39; with 60 and month &#39;2&#39; with 40. So the cumulative salary is as following.

<pre>
| Id | Month | Salary |
|----|-------|--------|
| 3  | 3     | 100    |
| 3  | 2     | 40     |
</pre>
