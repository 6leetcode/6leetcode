### [Biggest Window Between Visits](https://leetcode.com/problems/biggest-window-between-visits)

<p>Table: <code>UserVisits</code></p>

<pre>
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| visit_date  | date |
+-------------+------+
This table does not have a primary key.
This table contains logs of the dates that users vistied a certain retailer.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assume today&#39;s date is <code>&#39;2021-1-1&#39;</code>.</p>

<p>Write an SQL query that will, for each <code>user_id</code>, find out the largest <code>window</code> of days between each visit and the one right after it (or today if you are considering the last visit).</p>

<p>Return the result table ordered by <code>user_id</code>.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<pre>
UserVisits table:
+---------+------------+
| user_id | visit_date |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | 2020-11-28 |
| 1       | 2020-10-20 |

| 2       | 2020-12-9  |
| 3       | 2020-11-11 |

| user_id | biggest_window|
+---------+---------------+
| 1       | 39            |
| 2       | 65            |

For the first user, the windows in question are between dates:
    - 2020-10-20 and 2020-11-28 with a total of 39 days. 
    - 2020-11-28 and 2020-12-3 with a total of 5 days. 
    - 2020-12-3 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 29 days.
Making the biggest window the one with 39 days.
For the second user, the windows in question are between dates:
    - 2020-10-5 and 2020-12-9 with a total of 65 days.
    - 2020-12-9 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 23 days.
Making the biggest window the one with 65 days.
For the third user, the only window in question is between dates 2020-11-11 and 2021-1-1 with a total of 51 days.</pre>
