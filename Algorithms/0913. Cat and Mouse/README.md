### [Cat and Mouse](https://leetcode.com/problems/cat-and-mouse)

<p>A game on an <strong>undirected</strong> graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.</p>

<p>The graph is given as follows: <code>graph[a]</code> is a list of all nodes <code>b</code> such that <code>ab</code> is an edge of the graph.</p>

<p>Mouse starts at node 1 and goes first, Cat starts at node 2 and goes second, and there is a Hole at node 0.</p>

<p>During each player&#39;s turn, they <strong>must</strong> travel along one&nbsp;edge of the graph that meets where they are.&nbsp; For example, if the Mouse is at node <code>1</code>, it <strong>must</strong> travel to any node in <code>graph[1]</code>.</p>

<p>Additionally, it is not allowed for the Cat to travel to the Hole (node 0.)</p>

<p>Then, the game can end in 3 ways:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If ever the Cat occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Cat wins.</li>
	<li>If ever the Mouse reaches the Hole, the Mouse wins.</li>
	<li>If ever a position is repeated (ie.&nbsp;the players are in the same position as a previous turn, and&nbsp;it is the same player&#39;s turn to move), the game is a draw.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a <code>graph</code>, and assuming both players play optimally, return <code>1</code>&nbsp;if the game is won by Mouse, <code>2</code>&nbsp;if the game is won by Cat, and <code>0</code>&nbsp;if the game is a draw.</p>
