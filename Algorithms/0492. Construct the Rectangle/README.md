### [Construct the Rectangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle)

<p>
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:<pre>
1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
<br>2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
<br>3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
</pre>
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
</p>


<p><b>Example:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> 4
<b>Output:</b> [2, 2]
<b>Explanation:</b> The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li>The given area won't exceed 10,000,000 and is a positive integer</li>
<li>The web page's width and length you designed must be positive integers.</li>
</ol>
