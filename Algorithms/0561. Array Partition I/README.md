### [Array Partition I](https://leetcode.com/problems/array-partition-i)

<p>
Given an array of <b>2n</b> integers, your task is to group these integers into <b>n</b> pairs of integer, say (a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>), (a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>), ..., (a<sub>n</sub>, b<sub>n</sub>) which makes sum of min(a<sub>i</sub>, b<sub>i</sub>) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,4,3,2]

<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4 = min(1, 2) + min(3, 4).
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br>
<ol>
<li><b>n</b> is a positive integer, which is in the range of [1, 10000].</li>
<li>All the integers in the array will be in the range of [-10000, 10000].</li>
</ol>
