### [Shortest Word Distance II](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-word-distance-ii)

<p>Design a class which receives a list of words in the constructor, and implements a method that takes two words <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em> and return the shortest distance between these two words in the list. Your method will be called <em>repeatedly</em> many times with different parameters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong><br />
Assume that words = <code>[&quot;practice&quot;, &quot;makes&quot;, &quot;perfect&quot;, &quot;coding&quot;, &quot;makes&quot;]</code>.</p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> <em>word1</em> = <code>&ldquo;coding&rdquo;</code>, <em>word2</em> = <code>&ldquo;practice&rdquo;</code>
<b>Output:</b> 3
</pre>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> <em>word1</em> = <code>&quot;makes&quot;</code>, <em>word2</em> = <code>&quot;coding&quot;</code>
<b>Output:</b> 1</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
You may assume that <em>word1</em> <strong>does not equal to</strong> <em>word2</em>, and <em>word1</em> and <em>word2</em> are both in the list.</p>
