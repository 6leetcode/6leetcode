### [Statistics from a Large Sample](https://leetcode.com/problems/statistics-from-a-large-sample)

<p>We sampled integers between <code>0</code> and <code>255</code>, and stored the results in an array <code>count</code>:&nbsp; <code>count[k]</code> is the number of integers we sampled equal to <code>k</code>.</p>

<p>Return the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the sample respectively, as an array of <strong>floating point numbers</strong>.&nbsp; The mode is guaranteed to be unique.</p>

<p><em>(Recall that the median of a sample is:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li><em>The middle element, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is odd;</em></li>
	<li><em>The average of the middle two elements, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is even.)</em></li>
</ul>
