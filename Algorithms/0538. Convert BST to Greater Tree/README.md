### [Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-bst-to-greater-tree)

<p>Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b> The root of a Binary Search Tree like this:
              5
            /   \
           2     13

<b>Output:</b> The root of a Greater Tree like this:
             18
            /   \
          20     13
</pre>
