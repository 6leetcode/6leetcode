### [Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-repeating-character-replacement)

<p>Given a string <code>s</code>&nbsp;that consists of only uppercase English letters, you can perform at most <code>k</code> operations on that string.</p>

<p>In one operation, you can choose <strong>any</strong> character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character.</p>

<p>Find the length of the longest sub-string containing all repeating letters you can get after performing the above operations.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b><br />
Both the string&#39;s length and <i>k</i> will not exceed 10<sup>4</sup>.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
s = &quot;ABAB&quot;, k = 2

<b>Output:</b>
4

<b>Explanation:</b>
Replace the two &#39;A&#39;s with two &#39;B&#39;s or vice versa.

<p><b>Example 2:</b></p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
s = &quot;AABABBA&quot;, k = 1

<b>Output:</b>
4

<b>Explanation:</b>
Replace the one &#39;A&#39; in the middle with &#39;B&#39; and form &quot;AABBBBA&quot;.
