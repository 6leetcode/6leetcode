### [Water and Jug Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/water-and-jug-problem)

<p>You are given two jugs with capacities <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly <i>z</i> litres using these two jugs.</p>

<p>If <i>z</i> liters of water is measurable, you must have <i>z</i> liters of water contained within <b>one or both buckets</b> by the end.</p>

<p>Operations allowed:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fill any of the jugs completely with water.</li>
	<li>Empty any of the jugs.</li>
	<li>Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.</li>
</ul>
