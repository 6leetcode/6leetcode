### [Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions)

<p>On a <strong>single threaded</strong> CPU, we execute some functions.&nbsp; Each function has a unique id between <code>0</code> and <code>N-1</code>.</p>

<p>We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.</p>

<p>Each log is a string with this format: <code>&quot;{function_id}:{&quot;start&quot; | &quot;end&quot;}:{timestamp}&quot;</code>.&nbsp; For example, <code>&quot;0:start:3&quot;</code>&nbsp;means the function with id <code>0</code> <strong>started at the beginning</strong> of timestamp <code>3</code>.&nbsp; <code>&quot;1:end:2&quot;</code> means the function with id <code>1</code> <strong>ended at the end</strong> of timestamp <code>2</code>.</p>

<p>A function&#39;s <em>exclusive time</em>&nbsp;is the number of units of time spent in this function.&nbsp; Note that this does <strong>not</strong> include any recursive&nbsp;calls to child functions.</p>

<p>The CPU is <strong>single threaded</strong> which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.</p>

<p>Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.</p>

<pre>
<b>Input:</b>
n = 2
logs = [&quot;0:start:0&quot;,&quot;1:start:2&quot;,&quot;1:end:5&quot;,&quot;0:end:6&quot;]
<b>Output: </b>[3, 4]
<b>Explanation:</b>
Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.
Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.
Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. 
So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.
