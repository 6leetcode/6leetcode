### [Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection)

<p>
In this problem, a tree is an <b>undirected</b> graph that is connected and has no cycles.
</p><p>
The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added.  The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.
</p><p>
The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of <code>edges</code>.  Each element of <code>edges</code> is a pair <code>[u, v]</code> with <code>u < v</code>, that represents an <b>undirected</b> edge connecting nodes <code>u</code> and <code>v</code>.
</p><p>
Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.  The answer edge <code>[u, v]</code> should be in the same format, with <code>u < v</code>.
</p><p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
<b>Output:</b> [2,3]
<b>Explanation:</b> The given undirected graph will be like this:
  1
 / \
2 - 3
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
<b>Output:</b> [1,4]
<b>Explanation:</b> The given undirected graph will be like this:
5 - 1 - 2
    |   |
    4 - 3
</pre>
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b><br />
<li>The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.</li>
<li>Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.</li>
