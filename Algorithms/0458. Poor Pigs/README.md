### [Poor Pigs](https://leetcode.com/problems/poor-pigs)

<p>There are 1000 buckets, one and only one of them is poisonous, while the rest are filled with water. They all look identical. If a pig drinks the poison it will die within 15 minutes. What is the minimum amount of pigs you need to figure out which bucket is poisonous within one hour?</p>

<p>Answer this question, and write an algorithm for the general case.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>General case: </b></p>

<p>If there are <code>n</code> buckets and a pig drinking poison will die within <code>m</code> minutes, how many pigs (<code>x</code>) you need to figure out the <strong>poisonous</strong>&nbsp;bucket within <code>p</code> minutes? There is exactly one bucket with poison.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>A pig can be allowed to drink simultaneously on as many buckets as one would like, and the feeding takes no time.</li>
	<li>After a pig has instantly finished drinking buckets, there has to be a <strong>cool down time</strong> of <em>m&nbsp;</em>minutes. During this time, only observation is allowed and no feedings at all.</li>
	<li>Any given bucket can be sampled an infinite number of times (by an unlimited number of pigs).</li>
</ol>
