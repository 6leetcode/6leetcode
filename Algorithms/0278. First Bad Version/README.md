### [First Bad Version](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-bad-version)

<p>You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.</p>

<p>Suppose you have <code>n</code> versions <code>[1, 2, ..., n]</code> and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.</p>

<p>You are given an API <code>bool isBadVersion(version)</code> which will return whether <code>version</code> is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b></p>

<pre>
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

<code>call isBadVersion(3) -&gt; false
call isBadVersion(5)&nbsp;-&gt; true
call isBadVersion(4)&nbsp;-&gt; true

Then 4 is the first bad version.&nbsp;</code>
</pre>
