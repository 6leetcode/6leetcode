### [Split Array With Same Average](https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-with-same-average)

<p>In a given integer array A, we must move every element of A to either list B or list C. (B and C initially start empty.)</p>

<p>Return true if and only if after such a move, it is possible that the average value of B is equal to the average value of C, and B and C are both non-empty.</p>

<pre>
<strong>Example :</strong>
<strong>Input:</strong> 
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
<strong>Output:</strong> true
<strong>Explanation: </strong>We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have the average of 4.5.
</pre>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The length of <code>A</code> will be in the range&nbsp;[1, 30].</li>
	<li><code>A[i]</code> will be in the range of <code>[0, 10000]</code>.</li>
</ul>
