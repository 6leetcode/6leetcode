<p>Write an SQL query to find for each user, whether the brand of the second item (by date) they sold&nbsp;is&nbsp;their favorite brand. If a user sold less than two items, report the answer&nbsp;for that user as no.</p>

<p>It is guaranteed that no seller sold more than one item on a day.</p>

<p>The query result format is in the following example:</p>

<pre>
Users table:
+---------+------------+----------------+
| user_id | join_date  | favorite_brand |
+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2019-01-01 | Lenovo         |
| 2       | 2019-02-09 | Samsung        |
| 3       | 2019-01-19 | LG             |
| 4       | 2019-05-21 | HP             |
+---------+------------+----------------+

Orders table:
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+
| order_id | order_date | item_id | buyer_id | seller_id |
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+
| 1        | 2019-08-01 | 4       | 1        | 2         |
| 2        | 2019-08-02 | 2       | 1        | 3         |
| 3        | 2019-08-03 | 3       | 2        | 3         |
| 4        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 4        | 2         |
| 5        | 2019-08-04 | 1       | 3        | 4         |
| 6        | 2019-08-05 | 2       | 2        | 4         |
+----------+------------+---------+----------+-----------+

Items table:
+---------+------------+
| item_id | item_brand |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Samsung    |
| 2       | Lenovo     |
| 3       | LG         |
| 4       | HP         |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+-----------+--------------------+
| seller_id | 2nd_item_fav_brand |
+-----------+--------------------+
| 1         | no                 |
| 2         | yes                |
| 3         | yes                |
| 4         | no                 |
+-----------+--------------------+

The answer for the user with id 1 is no because they sold nothing.
The answer for the users with id 2 and 3 is yes because the brands of their second sold items are their favorite brands.
The answer for the user with id 4 is no because the brand of their second sold item is not their favorite brand.</pre>
